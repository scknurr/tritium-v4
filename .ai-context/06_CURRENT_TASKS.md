### Task: Fix Data Inconsistency Between Timeline and Applied Skills

**ID**: TASK-001  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Started**: 2025-03-15  
**Last Updated**: 2025-03-16  
**Completed**: 2025-03-16

**Description**:  
Resolve the issue where skills appear in the Timeline but not in the Applied Skills section for the same customer.

**Progress Notes**:
- [x] Identified root cause: Timeline pulls from audit_logs while Applied Skills pulls from skill_applications
- [x] Fixed timeline configuration to use both entityType/entityId AND relatedEntityType/relatedEntityId
- [x] Added "Apply Skill" button to CustomerSkillApplicationsList component
- [x] Added user authentication check to get current user ID for the button
- [x] Improved component structure to be consistent with other skill list components
- [x] Implemented proper refresh mechanism with fetching function

**Solution**:
1. Added ApplySkillButton component to CustomerSkillApplicationsList
2. Added current user detection for proper button functionality
3. Restructured the component to have consistent layout with other skill lists
4. Ensured refresh functionality properly updates the skills list when new skills are applied

### Task: Implement Context Management System for AI Assistant

**ID**: TASK-999  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Completed**: 2025-03-15

**Description**:  
Created a comprehensive context management system for the AI assistant to maintain awareness of codebase patterns and issues.

**Implemented Features**:
- Created structured documentation with known issues, types, hooks, database schema
- Implemented repository detection for context-aware loading
- Added memory tracking across sessions
- Created task tracking system

### Task: Fix Historical Skill Applications

**ID**: TASK-005
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Started**: 2025-03-16
- **Completed**: 2025-03-16
- **Description**: Fix the issue with historical skill applications being flagged as duplicates.
- **Progress Notes**:
  - Identified that the database has a unique constraint on (user_id, skill_id, customer_id) that doesn't consider the end_date
  - Updated the ApplySkillButton component to handle historical applications differently
  - Added logic to detect historical applications (with an end_date) and update them instead of creating new ones
  - Fixed TypeScript errors and added proper null checking
- **Solution**: Modified the ApplySkillButton component to check for historical applications and update them instead of attempting to create new ones, which would violate the unique constraint.

### Task: Fix Timeline Accuracy for Skill Reapplications

**ID**: TASK-006  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Started**: 2025-03-16  
**Completed**: 2025-03-16  
**Description**:  
Fix the issue where reapplying a skill that was previously applied incorrectly removes the historical application and produces confusing timeline entries.

**Progress Notes**:
- [x] Identified the issue: When reapplying a skill, the system was updating the historical record instead of creating a new one
- [x] Modified the ApplySkillButton component to always create new skill application records
- [x] Updated the timeline description to distinguish between new applications ("Applied") and reapplications ("Reapplied")
- [x] Added is_reapplication metadata to track when a skill is being reapplied

**Solution**:
1. Modified the approach to always create new skill application records instead of updating historical ones
2. Enhanced the audit log descriptions to distinguish between first-time applications and reapplications
3. Preserved the full history of skill applications to maintain accurate timeline records

### Task: Fix Proficiency Level Updates for Skill Applications

**ID**: TASK-007  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Started**: 2025-03-16  
**Completed**: 2025-03-16  
**Description**:  
Fix the issue where users are unable to apply a skill with a different proficiency level due to unique constraint violations.

**Progress Notes**:
- [x] Identified that the unique constraint in the database doesn't account for proficiency level
- [x] Modified the ApplySkillButton component to handle proficiency level changes by ending the existing application and creating a new one
- [x] Updated the UI to show helpful messages when a skill is already applied but with a different proficiency
- [x] Enhanced timeline descriptions to clearly indicate proficiency changes

**Solution**:
1. When a user changes a skill's proficiency level, the system now ends the existing application and creates a new one
2. Added clear UI messaging to indicate when an existing application will be updated
3. Timeline events now show "Updated [skill] proficiency at [customer] from [old] to [new]" for proficiency changes
4. Added metadata to track proficiency changes, including the previous proficiency level

### Task: Fix Database Unique Constraint Issue for Skill Applications

**ID**: TASK-008  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Started**: 2025-03-16  
**Completed**: 2025-03-16  
**Description**:  
Resolve the database unique constraint violation that prevents updating a skill's proficiency level.

**Progress Notes**:
- [x] Identified the root cause: the database has a unique constraint on (user_id, skill_id, customer_id) that prevents having two records with the same combination regardless of proficiency
- [x] Implemented multiple approaches that failed due to database consistency timing issues
- [x] Successfully implemented a "brute force" approach that:
  1. Completely deletes the existing record
  2. Waits a sufficient amount of time for database consistency (3 seconds)
  3. Adds an audit log entry to preserve the history of changes
  4. Creates a new record with the updated proficiency level

**Solution**:
Implemented a "delete-then-insert" pattern with significant wait time between operations to ensure database consistency, while preserving historical data through audit logs.
